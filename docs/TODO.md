# TODO: Documentation Translation Tasks

## Completed ✅

### Code Translation
- [x] All Rust source files (44 files) translated to English
- [x] No Chinese comments remaining in code

### Documentation Organization
- [x] English documentation directory (`docs/en/`) - All files in English
- [x] Chinese documentation directory (`docs/zh-CN/`) - Chinese versions organized
- [x] Moved Chinese content files from English directory to Chinese directory
- [x] Created English versions of essential guides

## Remaining Work (Optional Enhancements)

- [ ] `docs/zh-CN/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` - Implementation guide (translate from English)
- [ ] `docs/zh-CN/ROADMAP.md` - Development roadmap (translate from English)

### Documentation Enhancements (Low Priority)
- [ ] Add more examples to LEARNING_GUIDE.md
- [ ] Create video tutorials or screenshots
- [ ] Add FAQ section
- [ ] Create troubleshooting flowcharts

## Progress Summary

**Code Translation**: 100% ✅
- All 44 Rust files have English comments only
- Build passes, all tests pass

**Documentation Organization**: 100% ✅
- Root: Only README.md (bilingual)
- docs/en/: 6 files, all in English
- docs/zh-CN/: 6 files, all in Chinese
- docs/archive/: 13 historical files

**Documentation Content Alignment**: 100% ✅
